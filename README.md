## Introduction
Welcome to the Image Segmentation with Meta's Segment Everything Library project! This project demonstrates the usage of Meta's powerful image segmentation library called "Segment Everything." Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves dividing an image into meaningful regions or segments. These segments can represent different objects or regions of interest within the image.

Segment Everything provides advanced tools and models for image segmentation tasks, making it easier for developers and researchers to create accurate and efficient segmentation solutions.

## Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```
